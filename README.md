Analysis on World Consumption habits in relation to public health indicators

This is the final for General Assembly Data Science course.

It is an anaylsis on two separate datasets, the world consumption habits dataset and the world bank's world development indicators dataset. 
My original intent was to see if I could find some interesting correlations between a nations sugar consumption and various health and economic indicators of a country. 
However as I found, there is no correlation between sugar and the nations health indicators I inspected.

The directory structure is as follows.
* Data - Contains data used in analysis as well as images taken from leaflet server
* ipython_notebooks - Contains all code used to conduct analysis
* leaflet_server - Contains all code for maps used in presentation
* Life Expectancy - Keynote presentation used for final project
